# Escape the Castle

A simple text RPG adventure game.

## Description

I first created a text RPG using Python on an OOP course for teachers. As I started to learn web design, I decided to upgrade the project to a web game. The code is likely very inefficient and brute forced as it was made in my early programming days!

## How to play

To play the game, type any of the valid actions in any case.
